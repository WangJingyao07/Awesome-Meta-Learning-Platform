# Tutorials

This section explains **how to use** the Awesome-META+ platform and provides a description of the application scenarios



## Getting Started

Awesome-META+ is a meta-learning software providing four levels of functionality for users.

* Many examples using meta-learning algorithms to train on a myriad of datasets/environments
* A functional interface for several popular meta-learning algorithms as well as a data loader
  to make it easier to import other data sets
* Lots of meta-learning related materials for reaserch and learning: papers, blogs, videos, reports, etc.
* A set of module interfaces for building a meta-learning framework

## Installing

### Plan 1

The services provided by this platform will be able to be installed in the form of python libraries through **pip** after **January 10, 2023**.

```pip install Awesome-META```

### Plan 2

### plan 3

Use **Git**

1. Create a new folder demo locally as a local code repository.

2. Go to the demo folder, right-click, select git bash here, and open the git bash terminal.
3. Enter the ```git init``` command in the git bash terminal to initialize the local repository.
   ``` git clone https://github.com/WangJingyao07/MetaLearning-Lab.git ```

### !!! tip

‚Äã    If you encounter a problem, feel free to an open an [issue](https://github.com/WangJingyao07/MetaLearning-Lab/issues) 
‚Äã    and we'll look into it.



## Examples

![few-shot](few-shot.png)

**Compute support and query embeddings**

~~~python
embeddings = model(data)
  support_indices = np.zeros(data.size(0), dtype=bool)
  selection = np.arange(ways) * (shot + query_num)
  for offset in range(shot):
      support_indices[selection + offset] = True
  query_indices = torch.from_numpy(~support_indices)
  support_indices = torch.from_numpy(support_indices)
  support = embeddings[support_indices]
  support = support.reshape(ways, shot, -1).mean(dim=1)
  query = embeddings[query_indices]
  labels = labels[query_indices].long()

  logits = pairwise_distances_logits(query, support)
  loss = F.cross_entropy(logits, labels)
  acc = accuracy(logits, labels)
  return loss, acc

**Create a Model**

~~~python
maml = Ameta.algorithms.MAML(model, lr=0.1)
opt = torch.optim.SGD(maml.parameters(), lr=0.001)
for iteration in range(10):
    opt.zero_grad()
    task_model = maml.clone()  
    adaptation_loss = compute_loss(task_model)
    task_model.adapt(adaptation_loss)  
    evaluation_loss = compute_loss(task_model)
    evaluation_loss.backward()  
    opt.step()
~~~
